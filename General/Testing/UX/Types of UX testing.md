### 1. User interviews

[User interviews](https://maze.co/features/interview-studies/) are a qualitative research method that involves having open-ended and guided discussions with users to gather in-depth insights about their experiences, needs, motivations, and behaviors.
#### When to conduct user interviews

This method is typically used at the start and end of your project. At the start of a project, you can establish a strong understanding of your target users, their perspectives, and the context in which they’ll interact with your product.  
By the end of your project, new user interviews—often with a different set of individuals—offer a litmus test for your product's usability and appeal, providing firsthand accounts of experiences, perceived strengths, and potential areas for refinement.


### 2. Field studies

Field studies are research activities that take place in the user’s environment rather than in your lab or office. They’re a great method for uncovering context, unknown motivations, or constraints that affect the user experience.
#### When to conduct field studies

This method can be used at all stages of your project—two key times you may want to conduct field studies are:

- As part of the discovery and exploration stage to define direction and understand the context around when and how users interact with the product
- During usability testing, once you have a prototype, to evaluate the effectiveness of the solution or validate design assumptions in real-world contexts


### 3. Focus groups

A focus group is a qualitative research method that includes the study of a group of people, their beliefs, and opinions. It’s typically used for market research or gathering feedback on products and messaging.
#### When to conduct focus groups

It’s easier to use this research technique when you're still formulating your concept, product, or service—to explore user preferences, gather initial reactions, and generate ideas. This is because, in the early stages, you have flexibility and can make significant changes without incurring high costs.


### 4. Diary studies

Diary studies involve asking users to track their usage and thoughts on your product by keeping logs or diaries, taking photos, explaining their activities, and highlighting things that stood out to them.
#### When to conduct diary studies

Diary studies are often valuable when you need to deeply understand users' behaviors, routines, and pain points in real-life contexts. This could be when you're:

- Conceptualizing a new product or feature: Gain insights into user habits, needs, and frustrations to inspire your design
- Trying to enhance an existing product: Identify areas where users are having difficulties or where there are opportunities for better user engagement

### 5. Surveys

Although [surveys](https://maze.co/features/surveys/) are primarily used for quantitative research, they can also provided qualitative data, depending on whether you use closed or open-ended questions:

- Closed-ended questions come with a predefined set of answers to choose from using formats like rating scales, rankings, or multiple choice. This results in quantitative data.
- Open-ended questions are typically open-text questions where test participants give their responses in a free-form style. This results in qualitative data.
#### When to conduct surveys

While surveys can be used at all stages of project development, and are ideal for [continuous product discovery](https://maze.co/guides/product-discovery/continuous/), the specific timing and purpose may vary depending on the research goals. For example, you can run surveys at:

- Conceptualization phase to gather preliminary data, and identify patterns, trends, or potential user segments
- Post-launch or during iterative design cycles to gather feedback on user satisfaction, feature usage, or suggestions for improvements


### 6. Card sorting

[Card sorting](https://maze.co/guides/card-sorting/) is an important step in creating an intuitive information architecture (IA) and user experience. It’s also a great technique to generate ideas, naming conventions, or simply see how users understand topics.

In this UX research method, participants are presented with cards featuring different topics or information, and tasked with grouping the cards into categories that make sense to them.

There are three types of card sorting:

- Open card sorting: Participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and name those categories, thus generating new ideas and names
- Hybrid card sorting: Participants can sort cards into predefined categories, but also have the option to create their own categories
- Closed card sorting: Participants are given predefined categories and asked to sort the items into the available groups
#### When to conduct card sorting

Card sorting isn’t limited to a single stage of design or development—it can be employed anytime you need to explore how users categorize or perceive information. For example, you may want to use card sorting if you need to:

- Understand how users perceive ideas
- Evaluate and prioritize potential solutions
- Generate name ideas and understand naming conventions
- Learn how users expect navigation to work
- Decide how to group content on a new or existing site
- Restructure information architecture


### 7. Tree testing

During [tree testing](https://maze.co/features/tree-testing/) a text-only version of the site is given to your participants, who are asked to complete a series of tasks requiring them to locate items on the app or website.

The data collected from a tree test helps you understand where users intuitively navigate first, and is an effective way to assess the findability, labeling, and information architecture of a product.
#### When to conduct tree testing

Tree testing is often done at an early stage in the design or redesign process. That’s because it’s more cost-effective to address errors at the start of a project—rather than making changes later in the development process or after launch.

However, it can be helpful to employ tree testing as a method when adding new features, particularly alongside card sorting.


### 8. Usability testing

Usability testing evaluates your product with people by getting them to complete tasks while you observe and note their interactions (either during or after the test). The goal of conducting usability testing is to understand if your design is intuitive and easy to use. A sign of success is if users can easily accomplish their goals and complete tasks with your product.
#### When to conduct usability testing

To inform your design decisions, you should [do usability testing early and often in the process](https://maze.co/blog/formative-summative-testing-design-process/). Here are some guidelines to help you decide when to do usability testing:

- Before you start designing
- Once you have a wireframe or prototype
- Prior to the launch of the product
- At regular intervals after launch


### 9. Five-second testing

In [five-second testing](https://maze.co/features/five-second-test/), participants are (unsurprisingly) given five seconds to view an image like a design or web page, and then they’re asked questions about the design to gauge their first impressions.
#### When to conduct five-second testing

Five-second testing is typically conducted in the early stages of the design process, specifically during initial [concept testing](https://maze.co/guides/concept-testing/) or prototype development. This way, you can evaluate your design's initial impact and make early refinements or adjustments to ensure its effectiveness, before putting design to development.


### 10. A/B testing

[A/B testing](https://maze.co/blog/ab-testing-prototypes/), also known as split testing, compares two or more versions of a webpage, interface, or feature to determine which performs better regarding engagement, conversions, or other predefined metrics.
#### When to conduct A/B testing

A/B testing can be used at all stages of the design and development process—whenever you want to collect direct, quantitative data and confirm a suspicion, or settle a design debate. This iterative testing approach allows you to continually improve your website's performance and user experience based on data-driven insights.


### 11. Concept testing

Concept testing is a type of research that evaluates the feasibility, appeal, and potential success of a new product before you build it. It centers the user in the ideation process, using UX research methods like A/B testing, surveys, and customer interviews.
#### When to conduct concept testing

Concept testing helps gauge your audience’s interest, understanding, and likelihood-to-purchase, before committing time and resources to a concept. However, it can also be useful further down the product development line—such as when defining marketing messaging or just before launching.
